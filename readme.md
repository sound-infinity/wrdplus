# What is WRD+?

WRD+ is a User-Script made to improve the user experience on the [WeAreDevs](https://www.wearedevs.net) website, mainly targeting its forum page.

## Features

-   User Background Image: _Allows you to set your own background image using a URL_
-   Know which threads you have read: _Helps you see whether you have visited a thread or not_
-   Thread Title Highlighting: _Highlights a thread's prefix if it starts with a tag (e.g.: [tag] Hello!)_

## Usage

Most of the features are not displayed right away. So, this section will help you understand how to use them and some of their purposes.

### WRD+ Settings

First settings, the most common thing within an application. And just like any other, it just allows you to customize some of the functions of the program. To **open the settings menu** press and hold `ALT` and then press `S`. This will show a popup/window containing the fields for you to edit or some actions you might want to execute.
