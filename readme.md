# What is WRD+?
WRD+ is a User-Script made to improve the user experience on the [WeAreDevs](https://www.wearedevs.net) website, mainly targeting its forum page.

## Features
* User Background Image: _Allows you to set your own background image using a URL_
* Known which threads you have read: _Helps you see whether you have visited a thread or not_
* Thread Title Highlighting: _Highlights a thread's prefix if it starts with a tag (e.g.: [tag] Hello!)_
* Tags: _Tags are made to you help organize your thread or reply_

## Usage
Most of the features are not displayed right away. So, this section will help you understand how to use them and some of their purposes.

### WRD+ Settings
First settings, the most common thing within an application. And just like any other, it just allows you to customize some of the functions of the program. To **open the settings menu** press and hold ``ALT`` and then press ``S``. This will show a popup/window containing the fields for you to edit or some actions you might want to execute.

### Post Tags
This the main reason there is a V2 of this script. These tags help you with making your post look "good" or at least I think so, personally they look good. Anyways, there are only two tags allowed, which are:

* Code: _Shows code (aka: text) in its own container and once it is clicked all the text within is selected allowing you to copy all of it with no effort._
* Spoiler: _Provides a togglable element to collapse its contents by default it is closed_

#### How Do I Make A Tag?
Simply initiate and close it by using this format:
[tagName]
contents
[/tagName]

**notice:** The opening and closing tags are required.

**notice:** The viewers who are not using this script will see plain text instead.
